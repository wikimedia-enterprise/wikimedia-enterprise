A cot side or bed guard rail is a raised side fitted to a bed to stop the occupant from falling out of bed. They occur:
			  - In toddler beds; however in infant beds the sides are to prevent intentional, rather than accidental, exit.
			  - In normal beds, where the occupant temporarily cannot be relied on exiting the bed safely.
			  - In hospitals where a patient cannot be trusted to stay in bed. Here they are detachable.
			  - On board small craft to stop the occupant from rolling out of bed when the boat rolls in heavy weather. Here they are fixed, and lower than the hospital variety.
			  - In bunk beds, normally not on the lower bed.
