ISO/IEC 2022 Information technologyâ€”Character code structure and extension techniques, is an ISO/IEC standard in the field of character encoding. Originating in 1971, it was most recently revised in 1994. ISO 2022 specifies a general structure which character encodings can conform to, dedicating particular ranges of bytes to be used for non-printing control codes for formatting and in-band instructions, rather than graphical characters. It also specifies a syntax for escape sequences, multiple-byte sequences beginning with the ESC control code, which can likewise be used for in-band instructions. Specific sets of control codes and escape sequences designed to be used with ISO 2022 include ISO/IEC 6429, portions of which are implemented by ANSI.SYS and terminal emulators. ISO 2022 itself also defines particular control codes and escape sequences which can be used for switching between different coded character sets so as to use multiple in a single document, effectively combining them into a single stateful encoding. It is designed to be usable in both 8-bit environments and 7-bit environments.
